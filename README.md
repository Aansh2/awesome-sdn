# Software Switch
- [OpenvSwtich](http://openvswitch.org/) - Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer virtual switch.
- [Indigo](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/indigo/) - Indigo is an open source project aimed at enabling support for OpenFlow on physical and hypervisor switches.

# Protocol

- [OpenFlow](https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/openflow) - A communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or router over the network.
- [OF-Config](https://www.opennetworking.org/technical-communities/areas/specification/1928-of-config) - OpenFlow Management and Configuration Protocol
- [OVSDB](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047) - A communication protocol which used to manage the OpenvSwitch database.

# Controller

- [NOX](www.noxrepo.org) - An open source development platform for C++-based software-defined networking (*SDN*) control applications.
- [NodeFlow](https://github.com/gaberger/NodeFLow) - An OpenFlow Controller Node Style.
- [ONOS](onosproject.org) - Open Network Operating System.
- [OpenDaylight](https://www.opendaylight.org) - OpenDaylight Platform
- [POX](www.noxrepo.org/pox) - A networking software platform written in Python
- [Ryu](https://osrg.github.io/ryu) - A component-based software defined networking framework.
- [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/) - A java-based openflow controller.

# Simulator/Emulator

- [Mininet](http://mininet.org/) - An Instant Virtual Network on your Laptop (or other PC)
- [Epoch](http://northboundnetworks.com/epoch/) - SDN simulator for Mac OSX
- [EstiNet](http://www.estinet.com/products.php?lv1=13&sn=13) - A world-renowned software tool for network planning

# Language

- [P4](http://p4.org/) - A declarative language for expressing how packets are processed by the pipeline of a network forwarding element such as a switch, NIC, router or network function appliance.

# Library
- [loxigen](https://github.com/floodlight/loxigen) - LoxiGen is a tool that generates OpenFlow protocol libraries for a number of languages.
